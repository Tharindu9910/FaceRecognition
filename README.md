Face Recognition Based Attendance System

Attendance is an important part of daily classroom evaluation. At the beginning and ending of 
class, it is usually checked by the teacher, but it may appear that a teacher may miss someone,
or some students answer multiple times. The main purpose of this project is to build a face 
recognition-based attendance monitoring system for educational institution to enhance and 
upgrade the current attendance system into more efficient and effective as compared to before.
The technology working behind will be the face recognition system. The human face is one of 
the natural traits that can uniquely identify an individual.
A Face Recognition Attendance System is an application that utilizes computer vision technology 
to automatically identify and record the attendance of individuals by analyzing their facial 
features. This system is a part of the broader field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), which 
focuses on the design and use of computer systems that enhance the interaction between 
humans and computers.
This system consists of four phases- database creation, face detection, face recognition, 
attendance updating. Database is created by the images of the students in class. The system 
keeps the authentic record of every registered student. The system also keeps the data of 
every student registered for a particular course in the attendance log and provides 
necessary information according to the need.
Typically, this process can be divided into four stages,
• Database Creation
• Face Detection
• Face Recognition
• Attendance Updating
